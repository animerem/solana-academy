1. How to setup a wallet
2. How to send a transaction
3. How to interact with a custom program

## Step 1: Install a Wallet

The Phantom Wallet if a free wallet that you can use to
send transactions. The wallet is capable of interacting
with the network and custom programs.

To start, install Phantom Wallet through the [chrome browser
extension store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phantom/bfnaelmomeimhlpmgjnjophhpkkoljpa).

## Step 2: Setting Up for Development

Once your wallet is installed, you will need to switch
the wallet's network to Devnet. We are using Devnet for
this tutorial because it is the easiest network to get
free tokens for testing.
